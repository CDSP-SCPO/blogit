## 1. Push to web survey, moving from snail mail to web surveys

According to [Dillman (Don. A. Dillman. (2017). The promise and challenge of pushing respondents to the Web in mixed mode surveys. Survey Methodology, 43(1): 3-30.)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-x/2017001/article/14836-eng.pdf), a push to web survey is defined as:
**the use of postal mail to obtain questionnaire responses from general public samples mostly over the Internet**

[Ipsos encyclopedia](https://www.ipsos.com/en/ipsos-encyclopedia-push-web-surveys) provides this:
 Also known as “web-first” and “web-push” surveys. A push-to-web survey is a quantitative data collection method in which offline contact modes are used to encourage sample members to go online and complete a web questionnaire. This method is typically used when sampling frames do not include email addresses for all members of the study population.

During [SSHOC](https://doi.org/10.3030/823782) and [ESS-SUSTAIN-2](https://doi.org/10.3030/871063) both European Commission funded projects, we have collaborated with the European Research Infrastructure [ESS](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/about/). We have designed a push to web data collection instrument using Qualtrics, detailed [here](https://cdsp-scpo.github.io/wpss-doc/use/push-to-web/#our-proof-of-concept).
